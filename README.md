<h2>Comparable</h2>  The Comparable interface in Java is used to define the natural ordering of objects. It allows objects of a class to be compared to each other, which is essential for sorting and ordering collections like arrays, lists, or sets. The interface is part of the java.lang package.
<h2>Comparator</h2> The Comparator interface in Java is used to define custom sorting logic for objects. It belongs to java.util package and allows sorting of objects of user-defined classes without modifying their source code. It is especially useful when:

1. We need multiple sorting strategies for a class.
2. We want to keep sorting logic separate from the class definition.
